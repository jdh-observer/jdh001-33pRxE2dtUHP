**Abstract** Combining historical inquiry with a hands-on and technical approach – involving the latest 3D modelling and desktop additive manufacturing engineering techniques – the Kinora replica project provides insights into the process of making a working replica of the Kinora motion picture technology from the early 1900s. About the Kinora The Kinora (1896-1914) is an early motion picture technology designed for home use. Originally invented and patented by Auguste and Louis Lumière in 1896, it was an adapted version of the Mutoscope, which similar to Edison’s Kinetoscope functioned as an individual viewing machine. Like the Mutoscope, the Kinora viewer made use of a flipbook mechanism in which a series of paper-based photographic cards were attached to a wheel. By turning the wheel and looking through the viewer, one could watch the series of photographs in motion. As such, the Kinora reminds of the principles of nineteenth century ‘pre-cinema’ optical toys, like the Phenakistoscope and Zoetrope, as well as paper-based animated portrait photography systems, like the Biofix and Filoscope. About the replica project Between April and September 2020, we – a historian and an engineer – joined forces to make a working replica of the Kinora. The aim of the project was to use replication as a heuristic method for better understanding this unique historical object’s materiality, functionality and (historical) uses. Our process of making the Kinora replica has been extensively documented by means of a series of lab diary notes as well as the production of many photos, videos, live action (GoPro) and 360 degree footage. This combination of written reflections and audio-visual documentation proved to be a valuable method for both capturing and analysing the replication process and its various phases of development. Methodologically, it enabled a reflexive and multi-layered approach in which the narrative, hermeneutics and data layers inform each other (see more on this below). Structure of the article The article is structured in six parts: (1) introduction, (2) historical context, (3) theoretical/methodological framework, (4) process of making the Kinora replica, (5) reflection: opportunities and challenges, (6) conclusion.

In the introduction, we give a short description of the Kinora replica project, the interdisciplinary collaboration between C2DH and DoE within the context of the “Doing Experimental Media Archaeology” (DEMA) project, and the aim of our collaboration to produce a working replica of the Kinora. In the article’s second part, we discuss the historical context of the Kinora as an early 20th century motion picture technology, its use cases, and some distinctive features of the mechanism’s kinematics. The third part addresses the theoretical and methodological approaches of the replica project, combining hands-on experimentation with 3D modelling, desktop additive manufacturing and replication as heuristics. The fourth part is the empirical part. After a brief introduction of the Engineering Lab’s 3D modelling and printing facilities and techniques, we will discuss the process of making the replica and its phases of development: from historical object to 3D modelling, and back. We discuss the various replica prototypes, their material and functional transformations, and how they enabled the testing of certain parameters (e.g. the optimal magnification degree and focal length of the lenses, the relation between the recorded frame rate and speed of rotation). The development of the prototypes helped to identify essential functions and corresponding technologies. In the fifth part, we reflect on the opportunities and challenges the replica project has brought us. How did the hands-on approach and “opening up” the Kinora enable a better understanding of the object’s materiality, functionality and usage? What were the main challenges of the replication process, and what have we learned from this from both a historical and engineering perspective? In the conclusion, we summarize our findings and provide ideas for future research and improvement of the Kinora replica model. The complete dataset (3D models) and procedure used will be at disposal of public at large.

In relation to the principles of the Journal of Digital History, the article offers a multi-layered approach. It presents a combination of narrative, hermeneutics and data layers that inform each other. The hermeneutic layer is presented in the fourth part of the article, in which we highlight our digital methods (3D modelling, desktop manufacturing) and historiographical approach (hands-on history, experimental media archaeology). The narrative layer is naturally presented in all the six parts of the article, in which we tell the story of our replica project through different phases: first the what, who and why (preparation and research phases), then the how (development phase), and finally the presentation of the outcomes of the replication process (analysis and presentation phases). By embedding short video montages and selected fragments from our lab diaries (all of which can be found in the data layer) in between the textual descriptions and analyses, we aim to connect the narrative, hermeneutics and data layers and thereby make our methodological approaches, development processes and research results explicit and transparent.
